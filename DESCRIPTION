Description: This package provides functions to analyze count time series with excess zeros. 
    Two types of statistical models are supported: Markov regression (Yang et al., 2013) and 
    state-space models (Yang et al., 2015). They are also known as observation-driven and 
    parameter-driven models respectively in the time series literature. The functions used for 
    Markov regression or observation-driven models can also be used to fit ordinary regression models 
    with independent data under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) 
    assumption. Besides, the package contains some miscellaneous functions to compute density, distribution, 
    quantile, and generate random numbers from ZIP and ZINB distributions.
